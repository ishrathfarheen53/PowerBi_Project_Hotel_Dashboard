VELORA_HOTEL BOOKING DASHBOARD

🏨 Hotel Performance & Booking Analytics Dashboard 

This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of hotel booking behavior, revenue performance, 
and customer loyalty patterns. 
It is designed to help hotel management and operations teams quickly monitor key metrics, 
identify trends, and make data-driven decisions to improve occupancy, revenue, and guest engagement.

At the top of the dashboard, key performance indicators (KPIs) highlight overall business health, including total booking count, 
cancellation percentage, total revenue, total room nights, and average room rate (ARR). 
These KPIs offer an instant snapshot of operational performance for the selected date range, 
which can be dynamically adjusted using the interactive date slicer.

The Stay Trend visualization tracks booking volume over time, making it easy to identify seasonal patterns, demand fluctuations, 
and peak booking periods. Complementing this, the Booking Count by Day Name chart reveals weekday vs weekend booking behavior, 
helping understand demand distribution across the week.

Customer behavior is further explored through segmentation visuals. 
The “Who stays with us?” chart breaks down bookings by loyalty level (Non-member, Essential, Preferred, Elite, etc.), 
offering insights into the contribution of loyal versus non-loyal guests. The “Loyal or not?” and “One night or more?” visuals provide a quick comparison of repeat vs new customers and short-stay vs multi-night bookings.
